(Stolen from BIVN)

Explode is a move I don't often see other players experiment with or at least use. But it has huge potential for making satisfying plays.

There are about 3 main categories to how I use explode:
1. Pushing players.
2. Pushing structures (Traps).
3. Bouncing structures off other structures (Ricochets).

Pushing players has been sometime I've done with explode since I got my hands on it. If a player liked high mobility, I'd be a dangerous opponent. They make one bad jump and I could  explode near them and it'd be a ring out.
Players in the air have no friction, just their current velocity and gravity. So if you hit an explode near them (explode ball off a nearby structure like a wall or cube maybe), they will be launched farther/higher (and be locked out of flow stone).
If you find yourself against a jumpy opponent, or can force them into jumping out of a tight spot, be prepared to send them flying!

Pushing structures, or using traps, tends to be done with three structures. One as the payload, one as the explosive, and the detonator (which can also have explode (they all can have explode if you want)).
For example this can be a Wall with an explosive grounded cube behind it that you trigger with another rolling cube that could also have explode.
*(Insert explode trap examples here)*

In some cases you can get away with two structures. That being the payload and the detonator that doubles as the explosive. An example I use on the Pit often is slinging an explosive wall at the wall of the Pit that explodes beside a boulder. Hopefully rolling into my opponent.
*(Example(s) of single explode traps)*

Lastly, bouncing structures, or Ricochets, is when you send a structure at another explosive structure that is weaker than it (ex. moving cube against corner of ungrounded explode cube) so that your rock suddenly changes direction and catching your opponent off guard.
